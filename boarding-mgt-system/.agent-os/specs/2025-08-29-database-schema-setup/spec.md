## Overview

Design and implement a comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema that supports all core entities and relationships for the ferry boarding management system. This foundation will enable multi-operator ferry management, complex scheduling, seat allocation, ticketing, payment processing, and customer service operations.

## User Stories

### Database Foundation for Ferry Operations

As a ferry operator, I want a robust database structure that can handle my entire operation, so that I can manage vessels, schedules, bookings, and customer data efficiently without data integrity issues.

The database must support multiple operators sharing the platform, complex route and schedule management, real-time seat availability, secure payment processing, and comprehensive audit trails. It should handle high-concurrency scenarios during peak booking periods while maintaining ACID properties for financial transactions.

### Multi-Tenant Data Architecture

As a platform administrator, I want a secure multi-tenant database design, so that multiple ferry operators can use the system without accessing each other's sensitive data.

The system needs proper data isolation, role-based access controls, and the ability to scale individual operator workloads independently while sharing common infrastructure efficiently.

### Reporting and Analytics Foundation

As a business analyst, I want a well-structured database that supports complex reporting queries, so that I can generate insights on booking patterns, revenue analytics, and operational efficiency.

The schema should optimize for both transactional operations and analytical queries, with proper indexing strategies and denormalization where appropriate for reporting performance.

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Entity Design** - Complete PostgreSQL schema for operators, ports, vessels, routes, schedules, and bookings
2. **User Management Schema** - Authentication, authorization, and role-based access control tables
3. **Ticketing and Payment Structure** - Booking, ticket, payment, and refund entity relationships
4. **Seat Management System** - Vessel configurations, seat maps, and allocation tracking
5. **Audit and Logging Schema** - Change tracking, system logs, and compliance requirements
6. **Performance Optimization** - Indexes, constraints, and query optimization strategies

## Out of Scope

- Data migration from existing systems
- Third-party integrations (payment gateways, SMS services)
- Database backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Production deployment and scaling configurations

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete PostgreSQL schema with all tables, relationships, and constraints defined
2. Database migrations using Go migration tools (golang-migrate or similar)
3. Comprehensive test data sets for development and testing environments
