## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Migration Tests**
- Test each migration can be applied successfully
- Test each migration can be rolled back without data loss
- Test migration version tracking works correctly
- Test migrations are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)

**Schema Validation Tests**
- Test all foreign key constraints work correctly
- Test check constraints prevent invalid data
- Test unique constraints prevent duplicates
- Test default values are applied correctly
- Test NOT NULL constraints are enforced

**Data Integrity Tests**
- Test cascade deletes work as expected (operator deletion removes vessels, schedules, etc.)
- Test referential integrity between related tables
- Test that booking capacity constraints prevent overbooking
- Test audit log triggers capture changes correctly

### Integration Tests

**Concurrency Tests**
- Test simultaneous booking attempts on limited seats
- Test optimistic locking prevents double-booking
- Test seat allocation under high concurrency
- Test schedule capacity updates remain consistent

**Multi-Tenant Data Isolation**
- Test operators cannot access other operators' data
- Test row-level security policies work correctly
- Test shared reference data (ports) is accessible to all operators
- Test operator-specific data remains isolated

**Performance Tests**
- Test booking search queries perform within acceptable limits (<200ms)
- Test schedule availability queries handle large date ranges efficiently
- Test indexes are used correctly for common query patterns
- Test database connection pooling handles concurrent requests

### Feature Tests

**Booking Workflow End-to-End**
- Test complete booking flow from schedule search to ticket generation
- Test booking confirmation updates seat availability correctly
- Test payment processing updates booking and payment status
- Test booking cancellation and refund processing

**Schedule Management**
- Test schedule creation with vessel capacity validation
- Test schedule updates maintain data consistency
- Test schedule cancellation affects related bookings appropriately
- Test recurring schedule generation works correctly

**User Authentication and Authorization**
- Test user registration and login flows
- Test JWT token generation and validation
- Test session management and cleanup
- Test role-based access to different operations

## Mocking Requirements

**External Services**
- **Payment Gateway:** Mock Stripe/payment processor responses for testing payment flows without actual charges
- **Email Service:** Mock SendGrid/SES for testing notification sending without sending real emails
- **SMS Service:** Mock Twilio for testing SMS notifications during booking confirmation

**Time-Based Operations**
- **System Clock:** Mock current timestamp for testing schedule availability calculations and booking windows
- **Timezone Handling:** Mock different timezone scenarios for international ferry routes

**Concurrency Simulation**
- **Database Connection Pool:** Mock high-concurrency scenarios to test booking system under load
- **Race Condition Testing:** Simulate multiple simultaneous booking attempts for stress testing

**Data Generation**
- **Test Data Factory:** Generate realistic test data sets for different ferry operators with various vessel types and routes
- **Booking Scenarios:** Create test scenarios for peak season booking patterns and availability calculations
