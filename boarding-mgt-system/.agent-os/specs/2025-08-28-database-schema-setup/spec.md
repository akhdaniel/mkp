## Overview

Design and implement a comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema that supports all ferry boarding management operations including ticketing, scheduling, seat management, operator/port management, and customer service functionality.

## User Stories

### Database Administrator Setup

As a system administrator, I want to initialize a properly structured PostgreSQL database, so that all ferry management operations have reliable data persistence with proper relationships and constraints.

The database should be initialized with proper schemas, tables, indexes, and constraints to ensure data integrity. It should include migration scripts for version control and support multi-tenant operations for different ferry operators while maintaining data isolation.

### Ferry Operator Data Management

As a ferry operator, I want my vessels, routes, schedules, and pricing to be properly stored and related, so that I can manage complex multi-route operations efficiently.

The system needs to handle complex scheduling scenarios including recurring schedules, seasonal variations, and special event schedules. It must support different vessel configurations with varied seat layouts and classes, while maintaining relationships between ports, routes, and operators.

### Booking and Transaction Integrity

As a passenger booking tickets, I want my booking data to be reliably stored with proper transaction handling, so that I never lose my booking or payment information.

The database must ensure ACID compliance for all booking transactions, prevent double-booking through proper constraints, and maintain complete audit trails for all financial transactions. Payment states and refund processes need careful state management.

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Entity Schemas** - Design tables for operators, ports, vessels, routes, and schedules with proper relationships
2. **Booking System Tables** - Create structures for bookings, tickets, seats, passengers, and payment transactions
3. **User Management Schema** - Implement tables for users, roles, permissions, and authentication tokens
4. **Support System Tables** - Design helpdesk tickets, chat conversations, and FAQ management structures
5. **Audit and Analytics** - Create audit logs, event tracking, and reporting aggregation tables

## Out of Scope

- Database replication and clustering configuration
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Performance tuning and query optimization
- Data migration from existing systems
- Database monitoring and alerting setup

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete PostgreSQL schema with all tables, relationships, indexes, and constraints properly defined
2. Database initialization script that can create the entire schema from scratch
3. Sample data insertion scripts for development and testing purposes
