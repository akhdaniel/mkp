## 2025-08-28: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a comprehensive boarding management system for ferry operations targeting the maritime transportation industry. The system will integrate ticket purchasing, scheduling, seat management, point of sales, customer service, and operational management into a unified platform. Core technologies will be PostgreSQL for data persistence, Go for backend services, and React for the frontend interface.

### Context

The ferry transportation industry currently lacks comprehensive digital solutions, with most operators relying on fragmented systems or paper-based processes. This creates operational inefficiencies, poor customer experience, and revenue leakage. The market opportunity exists to provide an integrated solution that modernizes ferry operations while being robust enough to handle offline scenarios common in maritime environments.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Build on existing POS systems**
   - Pros: Faster initial deployment, existing user base
   - Cons: Limited customization for ferry-specific needs, dependency on third-party

2. **Mobile-first approach**
   - Pros: Modern user experience, lower infrastructure costs
   - Cons: Reliability concerns in maritime environment, resistance from traditional operators

3. **Microservices from start**
   - Pros: Better scalability, independent deployment
   - Cons: Higher initial complexity, longer development time

### Rationale

We chose a monolithic-first approach with clear module boundaries that can be extracted to microservices later. Go provides excellent performance and concurrency for handling booking loads, while React offers a mature ecosystem for building responsive interfaces. PostgreSQL ensures data integrity critical for financial transactions and booking management.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Unified data model reduces integration complexity
- Single deployment initially simplifies operations
- Go's performance handles peak booking periods efficiently
- React's ecosystem accelerates UI development

**Negative:**
- Initial scaling limited to vertical scaling
- Go backend requires specialized expertise
- Monolithic architecture may need refactoring for multi-tenant scenarios

## 2025-08-28: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt Go with Gin/Fiber framework for backend API, React with Vite for frontend, PostgreSQL for primary database, and implement JWT-based authentication with Redis session management.

### Context

The system requires high performance for concurrent bookings, real-time seat availability updates, and reliable offline capability. The technology stack must support both modern web experiences and legacy POS terminal integrations while maintaining data consistency across distributed points of sale.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Node.js/Express Backend**
   - Pros: Larger talent pool, same language as frontend
   - Cons: Performance limitations, less suitable for concurrent operations

2. **Ruby on Rails Full Stack**
   - Pros: Rapid development, convention over configuration
   - Cons: Performance concerns at scale, less suitable for real-time features

3. **Java Spring Boot**
   - Pros: Enterprise-grade, extensive libraries
   - Cons: Heavier resource usage, slower development cycle

### Rationale

Go provides superior performance for concurrent operations critical in booking systems. Its compiled nature ensures consistent performance, and the static typing reduces runtime errors. The React frontend allows progressive enhancement and works well with intermittent connectivity scenarios common in ports.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Excellent performance for high-concurrency scenarios
- Type safety reduces production bugs
- Single binary deployment simplifies operations
- React component reusability accelerates feature development

**Negative:**
- Smaller Go developer pool may impact hiring
- Need to build some libraries that exist in other ecosystems
- Team requires training in Go best practices

## 2025-08-28: AI Integration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement AI-powered chatbot using a hybrid approach: Dialogflow for initial NLP with fallback to OpenAI for complex queries, maintaining conversation context in PostgreSQL with Redis caching.

### Context

Customer service costs represent a significant operational expense for ferry operators, with many repetitive inquiries about schedules, bookings, and refunds. An AI solution can handle 60-70% of queries automatically while improving response times and customer satisfaction.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Pure rule-based chatbot**
   - Pros: Predictable responses, no AI costs
   - Cons: Limited capability, poor user experience

2. **Fully custom AI model**
   - Pros: Complete control, domain-optimized
   - Cons: High development cost, long training period

3. **Third-party customer service platform**
   - Pros: Quick implementation, proven solution
   - Cons: Limited customization, ongoing licensing costs

### Rationale

The hybrid approach balances cost, capability, and implementation speed. Dialogflow handles common queries cost-effectively while OpenAI manages complex scenarios. This allows quick deployment with continuous improvement based on real usage patterns.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid deployment of basic chatbot functionality
- Scalable to handle growing query volume
- Continuous learning from customer interactions
- Reduced customer service operational costs

**Negative:**
- Dependency on external AI services
- Ongoing API costs for AI processing
- Need for continuous training and monitoring
- Potential privacy concerns with external AI services
