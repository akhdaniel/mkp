# Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your Knowledge Management System is ready to use. All dependencies have been fixed and the application can now run.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Add Your API Key

Edit the `.env` file and add your Anthropic API key:

```bash
# Open the .env file
nano .env
# or
code .env
```

Replace `your_anthropic_api_key_here` with your actual API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/).

### 2. Start the Application

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### 3. Using the Application

1. **Upload Documents**: Use the sidebar to upload PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, or XLSX files
2. **Ask Questions**: Type questions in the chat interface
3. **Get AI Responses**: The system will search your documents and provide relevant answers with citations

## 🔧 Resolved Issues

- ✅ Fixed `anthropic` library compatibility (upgraded to v0.64.0)
- ✅ Fixed `httpx` compatibility issues
- ✅ Updated all `langchain` packages to compatible versions
- ✅ Resolved numpy and protobuf version conflicts
- ✅ All core components tested and working

## 📝 Test Your Setup

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
python test_app.py
```

## ⚠️ Python 3.13 Note

You're using Python 3.13, which is very new. Some ML features (sentence-transformers) are not yet available. The app will work with:
- ChromaDB's default embeddings
- OpenAI embeddings (if you add an OpenAI API key)

For full feature support, consider using Python 3.11 or 3.12.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure your Anthropic API key is correctly set in `.env`
2. **Verify Installation**: Run `python test_app.py` to check all components
3. **Port Conflicts**: If port 8501 is in use, specify a different port:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
   ```
