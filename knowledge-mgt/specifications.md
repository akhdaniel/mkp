# Specification for AI-Chat with Documents Application

## 1. Executive Summary

An internal helpdesk system that enables employees to interact with organizational documents through an AI-powered chat interface. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector database storage to provide accurate, context-aware responses from uploaded corporate documents including SOPs, Q&As, policies, and training materials.

## 2. System Architecture

### Core Components

The application consists of four main layers working together to process and respond to user queries:

**Document Processing Layer** handles the ingestion and preprocessing of various document formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, XLSX). This layer extracts text content, preserves metadata, and prepares documents for vectorization.

**Vector Database Layer** manages the storage and retrieval of document embeddings. Using ChromaDB or Qdrant, this layer stores vectorized document chunks with associated metadata for efficient semantic search.

**RAG Engine** coordinates the retrieval and generation process. It processes user queries, performs semantic search, ranks results, and generates contextual responses using the Claude API.

**User Interface Layer** provides the Streamlit-based frontend for document upload, chat interaction, and administrative functions.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### Document Management

The system must support uploading and processing of multiple document formats with automatic text extraction and format detection. Documents should be chunked intelligently based on content structure (paragraphs, sections, headers) with configurable chunk sizes (default 512 tokens) and overlap (default 50 tokens). Each document requires metadata tracking including upload timestamp, document type, source department, version number, and access permissions.

### Chat Interface

The chat interface provides a conversational experience with message history persistence, context awareness across multiple queries, and source citation for all responses. Users can switch between different document collections, view confidence scores for responses, and export conversation histories.

### RAG Processing

The retrieval system implements hybrid search combining semantic and keyword-based approaches. It uses embedding models (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small or sentence-transformers) with configurable top-k retrieval (default k=5). The system includes reranking mechanisms for relevance scoring and context window management for optimal prompt construction.

### Administrative Features

Administrators can manage document collections, monitor usage statistics, configure system parameters, manage user access controls, and perform bulk operations on documents.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Python 3.10+
- **UI Framework**: Streamlit 1.30+
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB or Qdrant
- **LLM Integration**: Claude API (via Anthropic SDK)
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF2, python-docx, python-pptx, pandas
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI API or sentence-transformers
- **Additional Libraries**: langchain, tiktoken, numpy, scikit-learn

### Data Models

**Document Schema**:
```python
{
    "id": "unique_identifier",
    "title": "document_name",
    "content": "full_text_content",
    "chunks": ["chunk1", "chunk2", ...],
    "embeddings": [[0.1, 0.2, ...], ...],
    "metadata": {
        "source": "file_path",
        "type": "pdf|docx|pptx",
        "department": "department_name",
        "upload_date": "timestamp",
        "version": "1.0",
        "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
    }
}
```

**Conversation Schema**:
```python
{
    "session_id": "unique_session_id",
    "user_id": "user_identifier",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user|assistant",
            "content": "message_text",
            "timestamp": "timestamp",
            "sources": ["doc_id1", "doc_id2"],
            "confidence": 0.85
        }
    ],
    "context": "accumulated_context"
}
```

### API Endpoints

While Streamlit handles the UI, the backend exposes these core functions:

- `upload_document(file, metadata)` - Process and store new documents
- `search_documents(query, filters, top_k)` - Retrieve relevant document chunks
- `generate_response(query, context, conversation_history)` - Generate AI response
- `update_document(doc_id, updates)` - Modify document metadata or content
- `delete_document(doc_id)` - Remove document from system
- `export_conversation(session_id, format)` - Export chat history

## 5. User Interface Design

### Main Dashboard

The interface features a sidebar for document management including upload functionality, document list with search/filter options, and collection selection. The main chat area displays conversation history with message bubbles, an input field with send button, and a response area with source citations. A collapsible panel shows retrieved context and confidence scores.

### Document Upload Interface

The upload section includes drag-and-drop functionality for multiple files, a progress indicator for processing, metadata input forms for categorization, and preview capability for uploaded documents. Success/error notifications provide feedback on upload status.

### Administrative Panel

Available to authorized users, this panel provides system statistics (document count, query volume, response times), user management controls, configuration settings for RAG parameters, and document collection management tools.

## 6. Implementation Guidelines

### Document Processing Pipeline

1. **Ingestion**: Validate file format and size, extract text using appropriate parser, and preserve formatting where relevant
2. **Chunking**: Split documents using recursive text splitter, maintain context with overlap, and preserve section headers
3. **Embedding**: Generate embeddings for each chunk, store in vector database with metadata, and create inverse index for keyword search
4. **Indexing**: Organize documents by collection, implement efficient retrieval mechanisms, and maintain document versioning

### RAG Workflow

1. **Query Processing**: Parse user input, generate query embedding, and identify search parameters
2. **Retrieval**: Perform vector similarity search, apply metadata filters, and retrieve top-k chunks
3. **Reranking**: Score retrieved chunks for relevance, apply diversity filtering, and select optimal context
4. **Generation**: Construct prompt with context, call Claude API, and format response with citations
5. **Post-processing**: Extract source references, calculate confidence scores, and update conversation history

### Performance Optimization

The system implements caching for frequently accessed documents and common queries. Batch processing handles multiple documents simultaneously. Async operations prevent UI blocking during processing. Connection pooling manages database connections efficiently. Lazy loading retrieves documents on-demand to optimize memory usage.

## 7. Security Considerations

### Access Control

Implement role-based access control (viewer, uploader, admin) with document-level permissions based on department or classification. Session management includes timeout and secure token handling. All actions are logged for audit trail purposes.

### Data Protection

Encrypt sensitive documents at rest and implement secure file upload with validation. Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks and use secure API key management for external services. Regular backups ensure data recovery capability.

## 8. Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables

```python
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_api_key"  # if using OpenAI embeddings
VECTOR_DB_PATH = "./data/chromadb"
UPLOAD_PATH = "./data/uploads"
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10485760  # 10MB
CHUNK_SIZE = 512
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 50
TOP_K_RETRIEVAL = 5
MODEL_NAME = "claude-3-opus-20240229"
```

## 9. Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

Test document parsing for each format type, verify chunking algorithm accuracy, validate embedding generation, and ensure database operations integrity.

### Integration Tests

Verify end-to-end document upload and processing, test RAG pipeline with sample queries, validate UI interactions and responses, and check API error handling.

### Performance Tests

Measure response time under load, test concurrent user handling, verify large document processing, and monitor memory usage patterns.

## 10. Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include multi-language support for international documents, advanced analytics dashboard for usage insights, integration with existing helpdesk ticketing systems, mobile-responsive interface design, voice input and audio response capabilities, and automated document update detection and reprocessing.

This specification provides a comprehensive foundation for building a robust AI-powered document chat system tailored for internal helpdesk operations. The modular design allows for iterative development and easy maintenance while ensuring scalability for growing document collections and user bases.
