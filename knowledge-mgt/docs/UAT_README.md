# UAT Documentation Guide

## Overview

This directory contains all User Acceptance Testing (UAT) materials for the Knowledge Management System. These documents provide comprehensive testing procedures, automated scripts, and sign-off templates for validating the system before production deployment.

## Documents Available

### 1. UAT Test Cases (`UAT_TEST_CASES.md`)
Comprehensive manual test cases covering:
- 32 detailed test cases across 6 test suites
- Step-by-step testing procedures
- Expected results and pass criteria
- Test data requirements
- Defect tracking template

**Use this for**: Manual testing by business users and QA teams

### 2. UAT Test Scripts (`../tests/uat_test_scripts.py`)
Automated test scripts that:
- Execute core test scenarios programmatically
- Generate test data automatically
- Produce detailed test reports
- Calculate pass/fail rates
- Save results to JSON format

**Use this for**: Automated regression testing and quick validation

### 3. UAT Sign-off Template (`UAT_SIGNOFF_TEMPLATE.md`)
Formal sign-off document including:
- Test execution summary
- Defect tracking
- Risk assessment
- Performance metrics
- Approval signatures
- Go/No-go decision framework

**Use this for**: Final UAT approval and production release authorization

## How to Execute UAT

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. Review test cases in `UAT_TEST_CASES.md`
2. Ensure test environment is ready
3. Prepare test data as specified
4. Assign testers to test suites
5. Set up defect tracking system

### Phase 2: Manual Testing
1. Execute test cases following the documented steps
2. Record results for each test case
3. Log any defects found
4. Take screenshots of issues
5. Document any deviations from expected behavior

### Phase 3: Automated Testing
```bash
# Run automated UAT tests
cd /path/to/knowledge-mgt
python tests/uat_test_scripts.py

# View results
cat tests/uat_results.json
```

### Phase 4: Review & Sign-off
1. Compile all test results
2. Review defect list and resolutions
3. Fill out `UAT_SIGNOFF_TEMPLATE.md`
4. Obtain necessary approvals
5. Make go/no-go decision

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- All required packages installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- API keys configured in `.env` file
- Sufficient disk space for test data
- Network connectivity for AI services

### Test Data
Create the following test documents:
- HR Policy (PDF, ~2MB) - Employee handbook with policies
- IT Security Guide (DOCX, ~1MB) - Security procedures
- Training Materials (PPTX, ~5MB) - Onboarding presentation
- Budget Data (XLSX, ~500KB) - Financial information
- Meeting Notes (TXT, ~50KB) - Text documentation

## Test Execution Guidelines

### Manual Testing Best Practices
1. **Follow test cases exactly** - Don't skip steps
2. **Document everything** - Screenshots, error messages, observations
3. **Test both positive and negative scenarios**
4. **Verify from user perspective** - Think like an end user
5. **Report issues immediately** - Don't wait until end of testing

### Automated Testing
The automated test script covers:
- Document upload and management
- Basic and complex queries
- Performance measurements
- Error handling
- Multi-document scenarios

Results are color-coded in terminal:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green = Passed
- ðŸ”´ Red = Failed
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = Warning/Info

### Defect Management

#### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: System unusable, data loss, security breach
- **High**: Major feature broken, no workaround
- **Medium**: Feature impaired, workaround available
- **Low**: Minor issue, cosmetic, enhancement

#### Defect Workflow
1. Discover â†’ Log in tracking system
2. Assign â†’ Development team
3. Fix â†’ Developer resolves
4. Verify â†’ Tester confirms fix
5. Close â†’ Mark as resolved

## UAT Success Criteria

### Minimum Pass Criteria
- âœ… 100% of Critical priority tests pass
- âœ… 90% of High priority tests pass
- âœ… 80% overall pass rate
- âœ… No unresolved Critical defects
- âœ… All High defects have workarounds

### Performance Criteria
- Simple queries respond in < 5 seconds
- Complex queries respond in < 15 seconds
- Document upload completes in < 30 seconds
- System supports 50 concurrent users

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **UAT Lead** | Coordinate testing, compile results, facilitate sign-off |
| **Business Testers** | Execute functional tests, validate business requirements |
| **Technical Testers** | Run automated tests, verify integrations, test performance |
| **Business Owner** | Review results, approve for production |
| **Development Team** | Fix defects, provide support, deploy fixes |

## UAT Timeline (Typical)

| Day | Activities |
|-----|------------|
| **Day 1-2** | Environment setup, test data preparation |
| **Day 3-7** | Execute manual test cases |
| **Day 8-9** | Run automated tests, performance testing |
| **Day 10-11** | Defect resolution and retesting |
| **Day 12** | Final review and sign-off |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Tests failing due to environment
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Check API keys are valid
- Ensure network connectivity
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: Automated tests won't run
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with verbose output
python -v tests/uat_test_scripts.py
```

### Issue: Performance tests slow
- Check system resources (CPU, memory)
- Verify no other applications interfering
- Test during off-peak hours
- Reduce test data size for initial runs
