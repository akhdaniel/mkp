A: Yes, but follow your organization's data classification guidelines. The system is designed for internal documents only.

**Q: How many documents can I upload?**
A: There's no hard limit, but performance is best with under 1000 documents. Regular maintenance is recommended.

**Q: How long are documents stored?**
A: Documents remain until manually removed or cleared. Regular cleanup is recommended for optimal performance.

**Q: Can multiple users access the same documents?**
A: Yes, all uploaded documents are available to all users of the system.
