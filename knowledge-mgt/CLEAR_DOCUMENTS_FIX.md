# Clear All Documents - Fixed ✅

## What Was Fixed

The "Clear All Documents" button in the sidebar now works properly with the following improvements:

### 1. **Proper Confirmation Dialog**
- Two-step confirmation process
- Clear warning message about permanent deletion
- Separate "Yes, Clear All" and "Cancel" buttons

### 2. **Complete Cleanup**
When you confirm clearing:
- ✅ Deletes all documents from the vector database
- ✅ Removes physical files from the upload directory
- ✅ Clears the chat history
- ✅ Resets the uploaded files list
- ✅ Shows success notification with balloons

### 3. **Robust Error Handling**
- Primary method: Delete and recreate collection
- Fallback method: Delete all documents individually
- Error messages if clearing fails

## How to Use

1. **Click "Clear All Documents"** in the sidebar
2. **Confirm the action** by clicking "Yes, Clear All"
3. **Wait for confirmation** - you'll see success message and balloons
4. The app will automatically refresh with empty state

## What Gets Cleared

- **Vector Database**: All document chunks and embeddings
- **Upload Directory**: Physical files on disk
- **Chat History**: All previous messages
- **Session State**: Reset to fresh start

## Testing

Run the test script to verify it works:
```bash
python test_clear_documents.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Clear operation returned success
✅ Collection successfully cleared!
Documents after clear: 0
Chunks after clear: 0
```
